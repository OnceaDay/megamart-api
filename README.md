# MegaMart Backend API

## Project Overview
MegaMart is a backend-only RESTful API built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB (Mongoose)**. The goal of this project is to design a clean, modular backend that models a simplified e-commerce platform while demonstrating real-world backend best practices.

At this stage, the focus is **infrastructure, routing, and error handling** — ensuring the server boots cleanly, routes are wired correctly, and errors are handled in a centralized, predictable way.

---

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- Morgan (HTTP request logging)
- dotenv (environment variables)
- Nodemon (development server)

## Application Boot Sequence

### 1. Server Entry Point (`server.js`)
- Loads environment variables
- Connects to MongoDB
- Starts the Express server **only after** a successful DB connection

This guarantees the API never starts in a half-broken state.

---

### 2. Express App Configuration (`src/config/app.js`)

Responsibilities:
- Initialize Express
- Register global middleware
- Mount API routes
- Register 404 and error-handling middleware

Key middleware:
- `express.json()` — parse JSON bodies
- `morgan("dev")` — request logging

Routes are mounted under:
```
/api
```

---

## Routing Architecture

### Central Router (`src/routes/index.js`)
All feature routes are mounted through a single router:

```js
app.use("/api", routes);
```

Mounted resources:
- `/api/products`
- `/api/customers`
- `/api/carts`
- `/api/orders`

Each resource has its own router file to keep concerns isolated and scalable.

---

## Controllers & Business Logic

Controllers are responsible for handling request logic and communicating with the database through Mongoose models. Routes remain thin and simply delegate work to controllers.

Implemented controllers:
- **Products** — full CRUD with filtering, sorting, and optional pagination
- **Customers** — full CRUD with unique email enforcement and search
- **Carts** — add, update, remove, and clear cart items with total calculation
- **Orders** — place orders from carts, snapshot pricing, decrement stock, and manage order status

This separation ensures clean, testable, and scalable code.

---

## Models

Mongoose models define the core domain entities:

- **Product**
  - name, description, price, category, stock, images
  - supports filtering and sorting

- **Customer**
  - name, email (unique), address, phone

- **Cart**
  - one cart per customer
  - items reference products with quantities

- **Order**
  - snapshot of purchased items
  - total price calculation
  - status workflow: pending → shipped → delivered / cancelled

---

## Utilities (Shared Helpers)

As the application grew, repeated logic was **normalized into reusable utility modules** to keep controllers thin and consistent.

Utilities live in `src/utils/` and contain **pure helper functions** that are framework-agnostic and reusable across controllers.

### Implemented Utilities

- **`asyncHandler.js`**  
  Wraps async controller functions and forwards errors to the global error handler, eliminating repetitive try/catch blocks.

- **`validateObjectId.js`**  
  Centralized MongoDB ObjectId validation used across Products, Customers, Carts, and Orders controllers.

- **`normalizeEmail.js`**  
  Ensures consistent lowercase and trimmed email values when creating or updating customers.

- **`calculateCartTotal.js`**  
  Computes cart totals based on populated product prices and quantities, keeping cart logic consistent.

### Rule of Thumb (Dependency Hygiene)

> **If a file does not directly reference a library, it should not import that library.**

Example:
- Controllers **do not** import `mongoose` directly
- ObjectId validation lives in `validateObjectId.js`
- `mongoose` is imported **once**, in the utility that actually uses it

This keeps dependencies minimal, avoids hidden coupling, and ensures each file has a single, clear responsibility.

This normalization step improved maintainability, reduced duplication, and clarified controller responsibilities.

---

## Example: Customers Routes

`src/routes/customers.routes.js` exposes:
- `GET /api/customers`
- `GET /api/customers/:id`
- `POST /api/customers`
- `PATCH /api/customers/:id`
- `DELETE /api/customers/:id`

This confirms:
- Correct route stacking
- Controller-based logic
- Centralized error handling works as expected

---

## Health & Error Handling

### API Health Check
A health endpoint verifies API + database state:

```
GET /api/health
```

Returns:
- API status
- MongoDB connection state

---

### 404 Handling (`notFound.js`)
- Catches all unknown `/api/*` routes
- Returns a clean JSON response

---

### Central Error Handler (`errorHandler.js`)

Features:
- Handles all thrown or forwarded errors
- Respects custom status codes
- Logs stack traces in development
- Returns safe JSON responses to clients

This was verified using the `/api/customers/boom` route.

---

## Development Workflow

### Start the Server
```bash
nodemon server.js
```

Expected output:
- MongoDB connected
- Server running on configured port

---

## Git & Version Control

- `.env` is excluded via `.gitignore`
- Project uses incremental, meaningful commits
- Major milestones committed:
  - Express app wiring and MongoDB connection
  - Modular routing and centralized error handling
  - Domain models and CRUD controllers
  - **Utility normalization to reduce duplicated logic**

## API Usage Examples

### Products
- `GET /api/products`
- `POST /api/products`
- `PATCH /api/products/:id`
- `DELETE /api/products/:id`

Supports filtering and sorting:
```
/api/products?category=tech&minPrice=100&maxPrice=600&sort=-price
```

---

### Customers
- `GET /api/customers`
- `POST /api/customers`
- `PATCH /api/customers/:id`
- `DELETE /api/customers/:id`

---

### Carts
- `GET /api/carts/:customerId`
- `POST /api/carts/:customerId/items`
- `PATCH /api/carts/:customerId/items/:productId`
- `DELETE /api/carts/:customerId/items/:productId`
- `DELETE /api/carts/:customerId/clear`

---

### Orders
- `POST /api/orders/from-cart/:customerId`
- `GET /api/orders`
- `GET /api/orders/:id`
- `PATCH /api/orders/:id/status`

---

## Frontend Demonstration (Planned)

Although MegaMart was designed backend-first, a **simple frontend demo** can be layered on top to demonstrate a fully operational e-commerce workflow.

### Intended Frontend Responsibilities
- Display product listings (GET `/api/products`)
- Create or select a customer (POST `/api/customers`)
- Add/remove items from cart (POST/PATCH `/api/carts/:customerId/items`)
- Display cart totals (GET `/api/carts/:customerId`)
- Checkout and place an order (POST `/api/orders/from-cart/:customerId`)
- Display order confirmation/history (GET `/api/orders`)

The frontend will act purely as a consumer of the API using `fetch` or a lightweight framework (e.g. vanilla HTML/JS or React), keeping all business logic in the backend.

---

## Status

✅ **Backend complete** — models, controllers, routes, utilities, and error handling are fully implemented and verified.

✅ **Utilities normalized** — shared logic extracted and documented; controllers are thin and dependency-clean.

🚧 **Frontend demo (optional)** — planned as a lightweight layer to showcase the API in a full-stack context.

The MegaMart API is production-ready as a backend service and can now be demonstrated as a complete e-commerce application with a minimal frontend.
